Geoshape queries  Geowithin queries  Near queries  Atlas search aggregation best practices  Atlas search scoring overview The potential drawbacks and overhead that Atlas search might introduce into a cluster were also explained to the team. Since the cluster is currently on M10 general with limited IOPS of 1000 colocated atlas search can interfere with the disk IOPS of the overall cluster whenever the search indexes are rebuilt. Hence it was recommended that the team Copyright 2025 MongoDB Inc. 9 of 13 CONFIDENTIAL Ja v aScript Ja v aScript carefully monitor their balance of the clusters disk IOPS performance and geospatial query efficiency if they decide to move this query pattern to atlas search. 3.6 Schema optimizations During the engagement the schema patterns for all the collections being stored in MongoDB were reviewed and correspondingly some optimizations were discussed.

Some of the notable features of Atlas search are as follows Copyright 2024 MongoDB Inc. 23 of 27 CONFIDENTIAL Ja v aScript  Fulltext search  Fuzzy search  Typeahead Autocomplete  Text Scoring  Text highlighting  Support for the five most common Lucene analyzers standard simple whitespace language keyword etc  Support for multiple data types text numerics dates geospatial boolean and objectID Atlas Search queries take the form of an aggregation pipeline stage. The search stage performs a fulltext search on the specified field or fields which must be covered by an Atlas Search index. Normally we see the following definition to be used at the initial stage  mappings   dynamic  true   This definition indexes every field of a document inside the collection due to which the index size can grow very large when there are a lot of fields in a single document. For indexes to perform efficiently it is recommended that indexes should fit in RAM.

Copyright 2024 MongoDB Inc. 24 of 27 CONFIDENTIAL 4.7.3 Atlas search performance consider ations It should be kept in mind that search must always be the first stage of the pipeline. Documents can be further filtered down using match if needed to reduce the result set but it can drastically slow down query results. If possible design your search query so that all necessary filtering occurs in the search stage to remove the need for a match stage. The compound Atlas Search operator is helpful for queries that require multiple filtering operations. Hence it should also be noted that Atlas search can become a performance bottleneck if not used correctly. The performance considerations and impact while using Atlas search are documented here Performance Considerations . Further for using searchmatch or searchsort with Atlas search in an optimized way the usecase can be implemented in Atlas search as per the approach mentioned in the documentation using the storedSource .

A detailed overview of sharding was provided which involved evaluating the tradeoffs associated with it architecture of MongoDB sharding and best practices around it. Sharding is a horizontal scaling solution that distributes data across multiple machines called shards. Scaling horizontally comes with many benefits by breaking datasets into multiple smaller pieces. Having fewer data per machine allows for smaller or commodity hardware reducing cost and distributing load.
