For more information on TTL indexes please refer to the official documentation here . 3.6 Moving text search queries to Atlas search The team currently uses MongoDB text indexes for their textbased exact match query patterns and Atlas search for some of the autocomplete type usecases. It was recommended that the team can utilize Atlas search for both these purposes to improve their query performance. The team can follow the below sample query format on a sample collection to combine both exact match and autocomplete results in one query and manipulate the scores. Index definition on reviews.comments field  mappings   dynamic  false fields   Copyright 2025 MongoDB Inc. 9 of 16 CONFIDENTIAL Ja v aScript reviews   fields   comments    type  string   foldDiacritics  false maxGrams  7  minGrams  3  type  autocomplete    type  document      Corresponding Atlas search query  search   index  default12  compound   should    text   query  Our stay was excellent. The place had a breathtaking view.

One key concept that emerged was predicate caching a technique that involves indexing specific field values rather than indexing the entire field as done in traditional indexes. A useful MongoDB indexing feature for this approach is Partial Indexes . The recommendation was to track the most frequent query patterns and identify the range of values queried most often. To do this effectively it was suggested that the team use Atlas Scheduled Triggers see section 3.8  to periodically query this Atlas Admin API . This would allow them to retrieve the top K slowest queries pinpoint the exact value ranges for frequently queried fields and monitor these ranges over time. Once identified partial indexes could be created on these highcardinality fields improving query performance by targeting only the necessary subsets of data. This approach helps ensure that the indexing strategy remains optimized as query patterns evolve without overloading the database with unnecessary indexes.
